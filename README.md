First I made a virtual machine in Azure and based it in a different location than myself
</p>
<br />


<p>
I use my personal computer to search up my own Ip address using <a href="whatismyipaddress.com"> this website.</a> For obvious reasons, there is no picture of my ip address

I connected to the VM and searched the ip address

I then signed up to a VPN and searched the ip address.
